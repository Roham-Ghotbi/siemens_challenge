# Siemens Challenge

## Running the demo

The current version of the demo resides in `main/declutter_demo.py`. The robot's initial position should be sideways so its head can turn left to face the objects. If the objects are simple (objects whose defining feature is color), set the variable "simple" to True and the demo will use a color-based segmentation. If the objects are complex (color is not the defining feature) then set the variable "simple" to False and the demo will use an object detection network. If the objects are not simple, before running this script follow the instructions to run the web labeler in the hsr_web folder to start a server and run psiturk. Once the loading icon appears, you are ready to run the demo script. (the web labeler does not need to be run if the objects are simple) To run the demo simply execute:

```
python main/declutter_demo.py
```

At each iteration of the demo, the HSR will determine the level of clutter in the pile of objects and either compute a grasp point or execute a singulation. If a grasp is computed, the HSR will grasp the desired object, return to its start position to get a clear view of the AR markers on the bins, drop the object in the correct bin, then return to its start position to begin the loop again. If a singulation strategy is determined, the HSR will singulate the pile of objects and then return to its start position to begin the loop again. During the demo, the web labeler may ask for bounding box and class label for the next object if the demo is not confident enough about the objects.

To restart the demo, run `endcomm.sh` to shut down all server code. Also reposition the robot correctly.

### Running in Simulation

Assume you have run the web demo described above, so you see the "Loading"
symbol in the web server.  This needs to be running beforehand.

If you want to run our demo in simulation, use Gazebo and a launch file. For
instance, on Ron's machine, in this directory:

```
/home/ron/siemens_sim/siemens_challenge/sim_world
```

we can run this `roslaunch` command if we have the right files:

```
roslaunch test_room.launch
```

And then you should see a world show up in Gazebo.

(If there's an `IPython.embed()` command in there, just do a CTRL+D and
continue, the Python code will proceed.)

#### Creating a simulated environment

You can start by copying the existing code in

```
test_room.world
test_room.launch
```

which gives you an empty room with walls.

Be aware of the parameters you use for your environment: to support accurate navigation and joint control, you must include
```
name="use_laser_odom" value="true"
```
in your launch file and make sure your environment is surrounded by obscures.

#### Running demo in simulator

You can launch an environment we provided by running

```
roslaunch test_room2.launch
```

a room environment with a few cubes as grasping object and a basket as target would appear.

Please run `sim_main/test_labeling.py` for a demo.

NOTE: This demo currently only runs on Ron's machine: I tweak frame transformation in Chris' existing code to fit in the simulator for now. More work is needed to clean this up, potentially includes a slightly modified version of hsr_core.


## Forming a Dataset

**Update: see email I wrote to the team on April 10 at around 9am. That has the
most up to date documentation.**

One part of this process will be to form a dataset of images (from the HSR's
camera) of the setup. The setup involves varying the amount and location of
objects that the HSR will need to pick up.

To do this:

- Ensure that the HSR is in the appropriate setup, e.g. by moving the joysticks.
  (EDIT: no, use the script `get_hsr_imgs.py` which should position it
  "sideways".)

- Specifically, our HSR has joint positions as computed from the `ihsrb` mode:

  ```
  In [1]: whole_body.joint_positions
  Out[1]:
  {'arm_flex_joint': -0.005953039901891888,
   'arm_lift_joint': 1.408264702741982e-07,
   'arm_roll_joint': -1.5700016753088877,
   'base_l_drive_wheel_joint': -0.040536,
   'base_r_drive_wheel_joint': -0.014607,
   'base_roll_joint': -0.503419,
   'hand_l_spring_proximal_joint': -0.16177200000000003,
   'hand_motor_joint': 1.184772,
   'hand_r_spring_proximal_joint': -0.12877300000000003,
   'head_pan_joint': 1.500102405774593,
   'head_tilt_joint': -1.1500008266651047,
   'wrist_flex_joint': -1.569998402348724,
   'wrist_roll_joint': 0.0005735908368245113}
  ```

- Enter the `quick_img_collection` repository. Then after going into
  `hsrb_mode`, run:

  ```
  python get_hsr_imgs.py
  ```

  and repeatedly save images.  It uses IPython's embedding so you have to exit
  it, then it runs agai, etc.

- After you are done collecting images, we recommend moving the images in a new
  directory or saving it somewhere to avoid accidental deletion.
